                    We have deep roots and we have an original founder. We cook our chicken from scratch and our restaurants celebrate that
                    story. We use natural, high-quality materials and have all the conveniences to make everyone feel welcomed and
                    comfortable. From innovative ways to order to new restaurant formats, we are not afraid to constantly try new things
                    that make it easier to enjoy our chicken.

                    A lot has happened since Colonel Harland Sanders perfected his secret recipe over 75 years ago. But through all the ups
                    and downs in KFC’s pretty incredible history, there’s one thing we know for sure: the secret to being an iconic brand -
                    one that grows older, but never gets old - is to deeply understand who we are and why we exist.</p>
